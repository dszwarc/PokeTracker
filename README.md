Poketracker is an app created to keep track of all your different Pokemon teams!
Need to build a team to defeat a specific gym? Have a team that you need to win the cuteness contest? Keep track of all the different variations here! In addition, look up any Pokemon you want in the PokeDex. Search by name, ID, or ID range.


## App Overview 

PokeTracker was created using a MERN boilerplate. In addition to the MERN stack, PokeTracker uses API fetch and AXIOS in order to fetch data from the pokeapi, populating the details for all the existing Pokemon.

#### Technologies Used

  * Express
  * React

#### Getting Started

##### How To Use


1.  Visit the site at [PokeTracker](https://poketracker-web.onrender.com/)

2. Sign up for a free account. Add your Pokemon goal if you have one so other trainers 

3. Start creating teams and adding Pokemon from the PokeDex!

## Future Planning

As I develop this app further, I have several features I plan to implement. Mainly, I want the site to be more functional for actual team planning which means more statistics need to be displayed that I am pulling from the PokeAPI.

Key value pairs already exist for characteristics like typing, abilities, and moves. Therefore some planned future updates are:

- [ ] When creating a new Pokemon, add 4 unique moves from the Pokemon's moveset
- [ ] Be able to view a Pokemon's stats based on the level entered. (May need more information from another API)
- [ ] Be able to view Pokemon on teams in a detail page
- [ ] View other trainers' teams
